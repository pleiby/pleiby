- 👋 Hi, I’m @pleiby
- 👀 I’m interested in optimization modeling and data-science for energy-environmental policy analysis.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Julia/JuMP for optimization and R/rstan-Julia/Turing for Bayesian causal inference
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applied policy modeling or data science studies relevant to energy security and climate policy, and advanced mobility technology (automated/shared/electrified vehicles).
